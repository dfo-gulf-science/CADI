**To:** ASEC Planning Committee [Need to clarify to whom this should be addressed]

**From:** Concerned Employees of Gulf Fisheries Centre (GFC)

**Date:** 


We, the undersigned employees of the Gulf Fisheries Centre (GFC), respectfully submit this petition to formally oppose the implementation of a permanently unassigned seating layout within our workplace in the new Atlantic Science Enterprise Centre (ASEC) building.

While we understand the need for space-optimization and flexibility in the new building, we believe the proposed model of permanently unassigned seating will negatively impact employee **productivity**, **well-being**, and **collaboration**. 

Specifically, our concerns include:

1. _Erosion of Team Cohesion:_ physically fragmenting teams can impair their ability to communicate and collaborate effectively.

2. _Reduced Productivity:_ Constantly switching desks can lead to an increase in distractions and lost time associated with the configuration and customization of workspaces. Additionally, the erosion of team cohesion, as noted above can have a negative impact on a team performance.     

3. _Reduced moral:_ The removal of assigned desks disrupts daily routines, diminishes employeesâ€™ sense of belonging and stability, and can negatively affect morale. 

4. _Health & Hygiene Concerns:_ Shared desks increase the risk of spreading germs, especially during cold and flu seasons or in ongoing public health contexts.

5. _Equity and Accessibility Issues:_ Unassigned workspaces might have more difficulty accommodating employees with specific ergonomic needs or disabilities, potentially violating inclusion principles.

We urge leadership to reconsider the implementation of permanently unassigned seating and to explore alternative solutions that respect both the operational needs of the organization and the legitimate psycho-social concerns of its workforce. While it is known that this model is being widely deployed across the Government, adequate justification and rationale for imposition of this major change has not been put forth. We are requesting that more consideration be given to alternate models for seating and desk assignment which afford more flexibilty and personalization.
