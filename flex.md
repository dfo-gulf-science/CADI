**To:** ASEC Planning Committee [Need to clarify to whom this should be addressed]

**From:** Concerned Employees of Gulf Fisheries Centre (GFC)

**Date:** 


We, the undersigned employees of the Gulf Fisheries Centre, respectfully submit this petition to 
formally oppose the implementation of an unassigned desk layout within our new workplace in the
new Atlantic Science Enterprise Centre (ASEC) building.

While we understand the need for space-optimization and flexibility in the new building, 
we believe the proposed model of shared temporary workstations, characterized by unassigned seating, 
will negatively impact employee **productivity**, **well-being**, and **collaboration**. 

Specifically, our concerns include:


1. _Erosion of Team Cohesion:_ 
Unlike the unrealistic and improbable assertion that unassigned seating will 
encourage new spontaneous collaborations between employees, physically fragmenting _actual_ teams
will impair their ability to communicate and collaborate.


2. _Reduced Productivity:_ 
Constantly switching desks can lead to an increase of distraction and lost time associated with the configuration and customization of workspaces. 
Additionally, the erosion of team cohesion, as noted above will have a negative impact on a teams capacity to work efficiently.     


3. _Reduced moral:_ 
The removal of assigned desks disrupts daily routines, diminishes employeesâ€™ sense of belonging and stability, 
and can negatively affect morale. 


4. _Health & Hygiene Concerns:_ 
Shared desks increase the risk of spreading germs, 
especially during cold and flu seasons or in ongoing public health contexts. **QUESTION: Is there any research to support this concern?**


5. _Equity and Accessibility Issues:_ 
Unassigned workspaces will have a more difficulty accommodating employees with specific ergonomic needs or disabilities, 
potentially violating inclusion principles.


We urge leadership to reconsider the shared temporary workstations proposal and to explore alternative solutions that respect
both the operational needs of the organization and the legitimate psychosocial concerns of its workforce.


We request the following:
- Suspension of the rollout of unassigned workspaces until a thorough employee consultation process is completed.
- Consideration of hybrid or flexible seating models that retain a degree of workspace personalization, 
especially in the context of **employee who do not have remote-work agreements** and for **teams who are actively working together**.
- Provide employees with literature and documentation that substantiates these major changes that are being imposed on our work environment.
