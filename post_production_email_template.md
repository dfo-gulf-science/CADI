MY-MISSION Post-production

Hi ____,


We have processed your mission _______________ and you can find the summary page available on the DM Apps Cruises app :  __________________. 

You have been added as an editor of this page, so please feel free to make use of it as you like. Also, please take a moment to ensure the metadata is accurate.

### Andes Post-production site

Your mission has been re-instantiated on the DFO network and the link the post-production site can be found in the Cruises app detail page. Please note that if you intend to enter, correct or modify data on the post-production site, it is your responsibility to ensure that these data are being backed up. Furthermore, it is your responsibility to control which users have access to this environment. 

### Images
We have uploaded your mission's **image thumbnails** to the post-production site. Unfortunately at this time it is untenable for us to stage the full images on the container. Therefore, we will leave it to you to store / archive the full resolution images.

### CARL

We ran a comparison report between this mission's reference catch list and your "official" catch list on [CARL](https://dmapps/en/carl/). The updates have been synced and can be viewed in the change log of your regional code collection (INSERT LINK!). 

### Oracle

If these data are intended to be uploaded to Oracle, please make sure to coordinate with Pablo.


Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or run into any difficulty. 

Thanks, 
CADI Team
