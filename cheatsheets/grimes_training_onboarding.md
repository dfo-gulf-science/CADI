# Roadmap for GRIMES Training Module

- The list of training was imported from the Gulf Science Training Tracker in sharepoint.
- The list can be accessed in GRIMES here: https://dmapps/en/grimes/training/ (this is an administrative page)

### For each record, here is the checklist for what we have to do:

1. Click on `Edit` and check/ update the following:

- [ ] Ensure the name of the training makes sense (i.e., it is not course specific)
- [ ] If desired, provide a description of the training
- [ ] Set the **Certificate uploading requirement**
    - **Required** - the employee is required to upload a certificate
    - **Optional** - it is the employee's choice if they want to upload a certificate
    - **Not permitted** - The upload functionality is disabled for this type of training. Use when certificate contains protected information
- [ ] Set tags, if desired
- [ ] Upload an image
- [ ] Specify if **regular users allowed to add courses**
    - **Yes** - when the type of training is general, e.g., professional development
    - **No** - when the dropdown list should be controlled by administrators
- [ ] Set **options for training requirements**.
    - This will control the options managers have when assigning training to their employees
    - It will also control reminders received by employees regarding out-of-date training
    - The options are:
        - **every 1-6 years** - employees will receive reminders upon expiration
        - or, **one-time** - employees will not receive reminders
        - or, **as required** - employees will not receive reminders
            - NOTE: You will not be able to remove an option it has any attached profiles. For batch removal, use the `assign training` button 
- [ ] Set whether **this training is retired**. Retired trainings will not show up as options for employees


2. Make sure the course list makes sense

- A training must have at least one course in order for it to be selectable by employees when reporting new training
- By default, each training has a course named after it
- You can view / edit a course by clicking on the course hyperlink on the training detail page.
- New courses can be added by clicking on the **Add a course** button
- Click on the default course and then go to `Edit`.
    - [ ] Make sure the correct provided is selected from the dropdown
        - New providers can be added on the fly
    - [ ] Make sure the English name makes sense
    - [ ] Make sure the French name makes sense
    - [ ] Make sure the course number is provided, if applicable
    - [ ] Make sure the course url is provided, if applicable

3. Assign the training

- Finally, we'll have to make sure that a task has been correctly assigned. To do this, use the assign training button!
